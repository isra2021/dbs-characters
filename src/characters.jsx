In his appearances in the manga itself, he is also directly responsible for the murder of Goku's father Bardock, the genocide of the Saiyan race, the death of Vegeta, and the second death of Goku's best friend Krillin, arguably making him Goku's most personal and significant enemy, and the final confrontation between Goku and Frieza has been hailed as one of the most memorable manga and anime battles ever.`,
